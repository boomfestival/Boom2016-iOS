Inspired by the principles of Oneness, Peace, Creativity, Sustainability, Transcendence, Alternative Culture, Active Participation, Evolution and Love, it is a space where people from all over the world can converge to experience an alternative reality.</p>\n        <p>Boom is a festival dedicated to the Free Spirits from all over the world. It is the gathering of the global psychedelic tribe and of whoever feels the call to join in the celebrations!! Boom is a weeklong unpredictable and unforgettable adventure. It takes place, every two years, during the August Full Moon, on the shores of a magnificent lake in the sunny Portuguese inland and every one is invited!</p>\n\n<h3>PSYCHEDELIC FOR US MEANS TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX</h3>\n\n<p>Psychedelic means mind manifesting but has been associated as an atribute for music, arts in general and alternative ways of life. Our perspective on psychedelia is that every single individual is essentially free. Free to think<span>, to act, to create<span>, and to respect one another<span>. It is awakening a holistic awareness that all beings share the same pulse&#xA0;of life, that we are part of an interconnected Universe<span>.<span> We do not believe in the psychedelic orthodoxy that advocates to be pigeonholed in one style of music, one lifestyle, or one philosophy<span>. We also do not resonate with the narrative that <span lang=\"en\">psychedelic consciousness means intoxication<span lang=\"en\">. To be free is to be aware<span>, is to challenge the limits<span>, is to think outside the box and not to submit to the dominant culture.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<h3>BOOM IS A MODEL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS</h3>\n\n<p>An environmentally conscious event is a way to offer a concrete example that it is possible to live on this Planet in respect of Mother Earth and of one another. This is possible through a deep understanding of the cycles of life and humanity&#x2019;s place within these cycles. Permaculture is a brilliant example of how such an understanding can be turned into practice.</p>\n\n<p>Boom&#x2019;s pioneering Environmental Program applies the principles of Permaculture to every single aspect of the Festival production. Moreover, Boom widely promotes knowledge and practices of sustainability through lectures, workshops and&#x2026; practical example!</p>\n\n<p>100% compost toilets (still to this day the only large event in the world to reach this result!); 100% on-site water treatment facilities, off-the-grid energy solutions, bio-construction, permaculture gardens, vegetable oil for the generators&#x2026; these are just a few of the ground breaking projects that have granted Boom the most prestigious international prizes in environmental efficiency.</p>\n\n<p>For further details please visit the environmental program page.</p>\n\n<h3><img alt=\"\" class=\"align_center\" src=\"/boom2016/site/assets/files/1016/bf16_vision_950x450_c.jpg\" width=\"950\"></h3>\n\n<h3><br>\nBOOM BELIEVES IN A BORDERLESS WORLD</h3>\n\n<p>Since its beginning in 1997, Boom is the home of the global nomadic tribe. Since then, it has grown organically by word of mouth into an incredibly culturally diverse festival, attracting people from 151&#xA0;nationalities (2014). Boom is the celebration of the Earth&#x2019;s multicolored Oneness. EVERY ONE is invited and EVERY ONE is called to consciously co-create a positive reality of Love and Peace, for us and for the next generations. We Are One!</p>\n\n<h3><br>\nBOOM BELIEVES IN TRANSCENDENCE THROUGH MUSIC</h3>\n\n<p>At Boom music is sacred. The dancefloors are temples where to transcend ordinary states of perception and the limitations of our egos. Through dance and music, we can reconnect to our own individual divine essence, while in synch with the beating heart of the whole tribe. All in One!</p>\n\n<p>Scattered across four stages, music at Boom is as diverse as it gets: electronic, acoustic, classic, any style is welcome and represented in a different area, live concerts, djs sets, solo artists, bands&#x2026; Boom started as a psytrance festival and has developed into an inclusive gathering, unveiling the surprising diversity of quality underground soundscapes.</p>\n\n<p>Psytrance culture remains one of the inspiring sources of Boom&apos;s vision and intention and Boom remains as a testimony of the evolutionary potentials of such a culture.</p>\n\n<p>Check the pages for each of the&#xA0;areas for details on the different visions.</p>\n\n<h3><br>\nBOOM ACTIVATES TRANSFORMATION</h3>\n\n<p>Boom&#x2019;s ultimate aim is to facilitate individual and collective transformation. The Boom experience has been conceived to activate the vital force directing every being towards the fulfillment of its highest potential. To reach this ambitious goal, Boom relies on the continuous exchange of radically innovative knowledge and practices by countless Boomers, musicians, artists, teachers, visionaries, healers, farmers, ecologists, wisdom keepers, researchers, scientists, activists.</p>\n\n<p>Besides the music stages and the countless art installations scattered all over the site, the other areas where Boom channels transformation are the <strong>Liminal Village</strong>, the <strong>Being Fields (formerly known as&#xA0;Healing Area)</strong> and the <strong>Visionary Art Museum</strong>. Here our hearts, bodies and minds can receive a full download of information through workshops, presentations, rituals and meditations.

Boom is funded by the financial support of the thousands of people that buy the tickets and come to the festival.</p>\n\n<p>Boom does not believe in VIP areas and special treatments, since every Boomer is a VIP! Boom adheres to the principle of <strong>&#x2019;thinking outside the box&#x2019;</strong>, for the co-creation of novel ways of viewing reality and acting for its evolutionary unfolding.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Together, we make magic happen!</strong></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"align_center\" src=\"/boom2016/site/assets/files/1016/bf16_vision_950x450_b.jpg\" width=\"950\"></p>                <div class=\"bottom-spacer\"></div>\n    "

    "title": "Boom Theme: Shamanism",
    "body": "\n        <p class=\"summary\">As the Planet Earth is being transformed by human action, there is an ancient practice that is being re-awakened everyday.</p>\n        <p>After Water in 2010, Alchemy in 2012 and The Feminine in 2014, the theme at&#xA0;Boom 2016 is Shamanism.</p>\n\n<p>The term shaman has been used randomly around the world, as a healer, sorcerer or magician. There are thousands of ethnic groups that have shamans, we wanted to look at these ancestral practices and at the roots of our collective spiritual past, honoring a very broad and complex topic.&#xA0;Shamanic traditions are found in America, Asia, Africa, Oceania and Europe and all of them vary from each other&#xA0;and only some of them use sacred plants for&#xA0;altered and&#xA0;visionary states of consciousness.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p>Shamanic practices are the oldest cartography of the invisible world that we know. They are archaic practices, pre-monotheism, where soul travels to the realms of supernatural beings.&#xA0;They have been contributing to the surfacing&#xA0;of many ideas&#xA0;about the cosmos, heaven and hell and were then appropriated by many religions.</p>\n\n<p>In shamanism there is a strong ecological vision. Everything around us has life and identity. This mutual interdependency is an advanced ecological position, where everything has a spirit / essence / consciousness, a preface in the perspective of Earth as the&#xA0;largest living organism with numerous smaller organisms acting in interdependence.</p>\n\n<p>In Boom we celebrate the psytrance culture, a neotribal emanation of the connection between mind, body and sound. The recurrence of the word trance, takes us to its origins, to shamanism. All over the planet, shamans&#xA0;induced by the state of trance&#xA0;stimulated by the drum beats,&#xA0;travel through the invisible worlds to deal with the everyday issues of their communities.</p>\n\n<p>In Boom we are also celebrating the creative essence of the human being and shamanism has been suggested as the igniter of the art of cave paintings.</p>\n\n<p>In the early years of the&#xA0;20th century &#xA0;prehistoric cave paintings were discovered&#xA0;in the south of&#xA0;France which led&#xA0;to&#xA0;speculation on the semi-human and semianimal&#xA0;figures that&#xA0;were considered to represent shamans. Lommel in the 1960s popularized this theory in his book Shamanism: The Beginnings of Art. Nowadays, shamanic culture is one of the greatest inspirations for the planetary movement of visionary and psychedelic art, which is one of primordial elements of the Boom Festival.</p>\n\n<p>We also want to think about&#xA0;any appropriation that Western culture has made of Shamanism.&#xA0;Shamanistic practices have accompanied human history and recently&#xA0;science has proven the&#xA0;enormous therapeutic and spiritual potential of these practices. In spite of this,&#xA0;the world is witnessing a dissemination of these practices that is at risk of leading to&#xA0;an appropriation and decontextualization of these ancient, sacred rituals.&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p>Shamanic themes, practices and characters appear throughout the history, religion and the psychology of mankind. We have to preserve this ancestral knowledge that has survived several cultural mutations and stand firm preventing them from being&#xA0;contaminated by&#xA0;consumer culture that has become such a reality of&#xA0;being a human in the beginning of the 21st century...<br>\n<br>\nAt Boom, we are celebrating shamanism as a reverence to the cosmos and the wonderment of everything around us.</p>\n\n<p>May all beings be happy!&#xA0;May Boom 2016 be a collective manifestation of pure love, honoring the Shamanic traditions of imemorial times...</p>\n\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p>&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;<img alt=\"\" src=\"/boom2016/site/assets/files/1017/01-_ilustracao_completa1.jpg\" width=\"1300\"> &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p>&#xA0;</p>                <div class=\"bottom-spacer\"></div>\n    "

    "body": "\n        <p class=\"summary\">Every year a new series of rumors about Boom circulate on the internet and around the world.</p>\n        <p>So far the Boom production always chose to have a low profile, based on the belief that Boom is beyond faces and beyond single individuals. Nevertheless we wish to make some points more clear.</p>\n\n<p>So here is a list of various surreal rumors and our version of the facts! :-)</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;Boom is made by Free Masons&quot;/ &quot;Boom is owned by Illuminati&quot;.</strong><br>\nYou guys must have noticed the eye inside the pyramid in the 2012 imagery of the Dragon!! Good job! Be aware, we will send this and many more mysterious symbols for you to keep alert (but nobody is mason here!!)&#x2026;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;The Boom was sold to a commercial organization&quot;.</strong><br>\nNo way!! Good Mood Productions is the organization behind Boom Festival since its very beginning! Good Mood is in fact responsible for bringing Goa Trance to Portugal back in the early 90s and for starting the Boom Festival in 1997 (at the time in partnership with Monogatari). Besides Boom Festival, Good Mood has organized other events in Portugal and abroad (Brazil, UK, Israel, Goa), coordinated permaculture courses, curated art initiatives, developed environmental projects for festivals and natural parks, published the <em>Boom Book</em>, produced movies, DVDs and CDs (including the first-ever psychedelic trance cd by Portuguese artists). Since its inception Good Mood has gone through many &#x201C;seasons&#x201D;, people and teams, members have come and gone, migrating to different projects or departing from this dimension, while new ones have arrived, to keep the vibe alive. Since nothing in the world is done by one, two or three persons&#xA0;alone, it has been the talent and vision of many team leaders, team members, artists, unknown people, and crews throughout the years that have been fundamental to the adaptation of the festival to an ever mutating world. Boom is the result of a&#xA0;team of friends&#xA0;from many countries, in a non hierachical and consensus based decision making culture. &#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;Boom is owned by a rich Jewish/American company&quot;.</strong><br>\nHere we are really sorry to disappoint you!! Contrary to what seems a common belief, Boom Festival team is a group of&#xA0;people from Portugal and around the world and does not generate high profits. Revenues are applied on the Boomland and its projects. One part of the revenues is&#xA0;given to charity through the social initiative Boom Karuna Project. Team members are from many countries, enjoy a simple (and fun) lifestyle, focused in keeping Boom alive and working on several other projects. Most of the team live an alternative lifestyle across the world.&#xA0;Edition after edition, the festival struggles for survival due to its core characteristics. It is a festival with a non-commercial approach, a big investment in the environmental program, it gets fully redesigned after every edition, it has a strong social orientation regarding long term workers, and it has to survive within the hard-core Portuguese tax system and this means that production costs are extremely high.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;Boom was bought by Burning Man.&#x201D;</strong><br>\nWe love Burning Man a lot!!! And we are very happy that Boom is considered with Burning Man, one of the most transformational and revolutionary events in the whole world! But we are independent from one another.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;Boom owns a land where there is an ecovillage&quot;.</strong><br>\nAh!! This is a hot topic for many people who wish that the Boom was a &#x201C;permanent event&#x201D;! Though to this day Boom does not own the Boom Land. But the future is still open to infinite possibilities. There is a&#xA0;lease ending in September 2016, after that date Boom has to generate funds to buy the Herdade da Granja in Idanha-a-Nova (aka Boomland).</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;Boom is made by Brazilians&quot;.</strong><br>\nYes, the Boom Team has many fantastic Brazilian members, but there are also other hard working amazing people from 61 different countries (data from 2014)! Collaborating to bring&#xA0;Boom to life that allows us to transcend our nationalities. First and foremost we are all Boomers!</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;Boom is sponsored by a big advertising agency&quot;.</strong><br>\nWell, that would be true if this big advertising agency was made by all the Boomers who go back home and spread the vibe all over the world! Boom is a No Corporate Logo area with no other sponsors except the thousands of Boomers who invest their money in buying the tickets and coming to the festival. They are indeed the most effective and dedicated advertising agency that ever existed!! Without the Boomers there would be no Boom and they are at our thoughts and hearts everyday.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;Next Boom will be in France&quot;.</strong><br>\nWell, there is only one Boom that will always happen in Portugal, a psychedelic festival and gathering of free people, but we hope that there are many other Boom-inspired events sprouting all over the world! Probably other Booms will pop up with no association with the original Boom Festival, or even copying its name, we can&apos;t prevent words to be used on several domains by unknown citizens, but there is only one Boom Festival that started in 1997 in Portugal focused on the development of psychedelic arts, music, culture and sustainability. Spread the vibe, to France and beyond!!</p>\n\n<p>With Love and Eternal Gratitude<br>\nBoom Team<br>\n&#xA0;</p>                <div class=\"bottom-spacer\"></div>\n    "

It does not resist, it flows. At Boomland we take it seriously to clean the water that we use before, during and after the Festival. It is returned to nature as clean as we received it.</p>\n\n<p>All the water from restaurants, bars, showers and other facilities is recycled on site by a radically innovative biological treatment system. Boom&apos;s water treatment system is based on bio-remediation and evapo-transpiration. This means that all grey water (from showers and sinks) passes through a living filter before it is allowed to infiltrate back in the soil.</p>\n\n<p>The grey water passes through a series of garden beds where it is allowed to evaporate while the roots of aquatic plants undertake the first cleaning of the water removing minerals and storing them in their leaves.</p>\n\n<p>The remaining minerals are circulated with the help of enzymes that are added to the water, specially constructed to allow these biological cycles to develop.<br>\nAfter enough time has passed, a complete ecosystem develops in the water and around it. This is the natural state of water, providing habitat for many animals and plants and thus sustaining life.</p>\n\n<p>The result is crystal clear water ready for re-use in irrigation. No further treatment is required and all environmental regulations are met. In fact the water is tested.<br>\nBoom&apos;s pioneering water treatment facility is proudly on display right at the entrance of the festival. Here you can see several bamboo species, grasses, floating water plants and wetland species working together to clean the water. &#xA0;</p>\n\n<p>You can actively support this process by being conscious of saving water and using only what is necessary.</p>\n\n<p>In 2012 Boom was granted the prestigious &quot;Green Inspiration Award&quot; for this water system.</p>\n\n<p>&#xA0;<img alt=\"\" class=\"align_center\" src=\"/boom2016/site/assets/files/1022/bf16_environment_infographics.jpg\" width=\"950\"></p>\n\n<p><br>\n<strong>Free Drinking Water</strong><br>\nAll water fountains scattered across Boom Land offer free drinking water for your comfort. This water comes from the public grid, it is mandatory in Portugal events to be connected to the public water provider for health and safety reasons.

    "title": "Compost Toilets",
    "body": "\n        <p class=\"summary\">Many moons ago, Boom introduced the first 20 compost toilets. In 2006 it seemed like a radical idea. Nowadays, with exclusively compost toilets at the festival, Boom has become a model and has risen the global awareness to the benefits of this technology.</p>\n        <p>After several years of tenacious research, merging Boom technologies and knowledge with Ecocentro IPEC, an evolutionary scientific approach with partnerships with universities, DIY and DIT enthusiasts, Humus Sapiens, CompostEra, the Joe Jenkins approach, microbiology, and the specific characteristics of human dynamics at festivals, Boom has developed a unique composting toilet system for festivals.</p>\n\n<p>Boom&apos;s compost toilets relieve festival goers from the horrors of having to go into a plastic stinky dark chemical toilet!</p>\n\n<p><strong>And the output?</strong><br>\nSoil and liquid fertiliser ready to be used to create the Boom gardens!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Insights About Compost Toilets</strong><br>\nA &quot;Normal&quot; toilet is water-wasting. This technology, developed in the last two hundred years, flushes a 1/3 of the potable global water down the drain! Makes no sense when 780 million people are still without safe drinking water.</p>\n\n<p>This waste water goes into a sewage pit and then it is pumped into waterways and the ocean, thus regularly polluting marine environments. Septic tanks are also heavily unreliable. Absorption trenches often become clogged, overflowing into the garden or into underground water streams that could end up in rivers.</p>\n\n<p>And the difference with composting toilets - We make soil!</p>\n\n<p>The ethics behind composting toilets is that the soils of the world are either worn out and left without any fertile potential, or they are poisoned. The restoration and maintenance of soil fertility has become a planetary emergency. By collecting human manure in a festival of over 30,000 people we can create precious compost that can be added to soil for fertility!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Models</strong><br>\nThere are various models for composting toilets ranging from simple sawdust pits to the deluxe models where you don&#x2019;t actually smell or see the manure until it has converted to humus and is it ready for the garden.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>How do they work:</strong><br>\n&#x2022; You deposit your manure or pee. The composting tank is previously prepared with a special &quot;composting bed&quot; (with nutrients such as carbon) that facilitate the composting process besides literally neutralising the odors.<br>\n&#x2022; After your deposit you need to close the toilet lid. This keeps the heat IN and flies OUT!<br>\nNote: Unfortunately most female hygiene products and nappies are made of plastic and chemicals. They must not be thrown in the toilet as they take decades to decompose. Please don&apos;t throw cigarette butts or plastic material or any chemicals into the toilets either!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are compost toilets at Boom safe?</strong><br>\nYes! The secret to a safe composting toilet are the two T&apos;s - time and temperature.<br>\nThere are many pathogen-killing processes that occur in composting human manure on its way to becoming soil. At Boom we rely on time and temperature to kill these organisms.</p>\n\n<p>According to the master of poop, Joseph Jenkins (check out his book &#x201C;The Humanure Handbook&#x201D;) time is a major factor since human pathogens outside the human body die within a few months . Yet some pathogens may take months to die, so at Boom we keep the &quot;pile&quot; in the composting tanks for at least six months.</p>\n\n<p>High Temperature is the other method for killing these organisms. By keeping the &quot;pile&quot; at 50&#xBA;C for 3 days (which is not difficult in Idanha-a-Nova!!), human pathogens will likely die. A combination of time and temperature will kill all pathogens.</p>\n\n<p>The resulting material is then analysed in a laboratory. If the results are positive, all is returned to the land to create gardens.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"align_center\" src=\"/boom2016/site/assets/files/1023/bf16_environment_infographics3.jpg\" width=\"950\"></p>                <div class=\"bottom-spacer\"></div>\n    "

Given that the construction and manufacturing industry are responsible for the emission of almost 6 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide globally (data from 2008 on statista.com), the Boom experience demonstrates the realistic solutions that are available using alternatives methods, such as bio-construction and conscious living.</p>\n\n<p>Our bio-construction projects minimise the use of products that require a considerable amount of embodied energy for their manufacture or transportation. We are also inspired by ancestral building techniques infused with a contemporary technological perspective for fruition at Boom.</p>\n\n<p>Most of Boom is built from scratch, with designers challenged by the equation: 1 natural building = 1 piece of art.</p>\n\n<p>We seek to harmoniously connect technologies with functional, artistic and decorative concepts in a natural environment that we simultaneously aim to protect; thus, satisfying our physical and spiritual needs.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"align_center\" src=\"/boom2016/site/assets/files/1042/bf16_environment_infographics5.jpg\" width=\"950\"></p>                <div class=\"bottom-spacer\"></div>\n    "

It takes Mother Nature up to 500 years to make 2 cm of soil and humans 2 minutes to destroy it through unsustainable practices. Yet by simply composting your food scraps and using dry toilets you are making soil.</p>\n\n<p>In 2012 and 2014 we collected all the organic waste from the restaurants. This included the bio disposable bamboo plates and cups which amounted to 44 tons of organic waste collected in 2014. It is expected that &#x2155; of this amount will be turned into compost to make soil for agriculture at the Boomland.</p>\n\n<p>This soil is given back to the Earth in the form of gardens creating organic food for you to collect in 2016. You can turn your food scraps into soil by simply throwing them in the right bin. And let us do the rest!</p>\n\n<p><strong>RECYCLING</strong></p>\n\n<p>Recycling is one of our greatest challenges. The separation and recycling of garbage was completed outside of Boomland at a recycling unit. It was collected by the Ecoteam during the festival, placed in containers across the site, then removed and later separated in a public recycling unit called Valnor. &#xA0;</p>\n\n<p>Throw your recyclables in the designated bins, making sure that more stuff will be recycled into other things!</p>\n\n<p>Please check the table below for a better comprehension of our evolution.</p>\n\n<p><strong>REUSE</strong></p>\n\n<p>Did you notice those glowing jelly fishes that served as lights along the nocturnal footpaths of Boom 2014? Did you know they were made from old plastic water bottles?

The warmth of the sun is&#xA0;the right form of energy to multiply the ecstatic properties of Psytrance and Full-On, or&#xA0;classic Goa Trance and its Nu School adaptation.

That&apos;s what happened in 2006 when Boom launched its first visionary art gallery.&#xA0;<br>\nFast forward to 2016! The Museum of Visionary Art is&#xA0;actually quite a logical step in the evolution of the festival. There&apos;s a long tradition of live paintings, workshops and exhibitions. The visual appearance of Boom has been shaped by countless visual artists, and at the same time many of these artists have been inspired by the Boom experience.</p>\n\n<p>The Museum of Visionary Art is a place to showcase this dynamic process in a way that is just as sophisticated and beautiful as the art itself.</p>\n\n<p>Visiting this cosmic gallery is like a journey through the history of psychedelic and visionary art, its influences and techniques. It&apos;s a mesmerizing collection of Amazonian and indigenous Medicine Art, Tibetan Buddhist Tradition, Electro Mineralism,&#xA0;Flemish Technique and Visionary Activist Art alongside with modern styles like Digital Fusionism, Sacred Geometry, Visionary Psytrance Deco Art, Visionary Graffiti Art.</p>\n\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n        <h2></h2>\n                <div class=\"stage-artists-container\">\n                        <div class=\"clearfix\">&#xA0;</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p></p>\n\t\t\t    \t\t\t\n                        <div class=\"bottom-spacer\"></div>\n        </div>\n    "

Why? Because the term &apos;party&apos; implies something that is basically just another dose of dancefloor action. Of course that&apos;s one important aspect of Boom &#x2013; but there&apos;s so much more. That&apos;s the idea behind the Utopia Boom Landing.</p>\n\n<p>This gathering is similar to Boom, yet different. To create an intimate family vibe, it&apos;s much smaller. To re-calibrate the biological rhythm of the human body, the party takes place only during the daylight hours. To make the integration of new experiences and ideas into everyday life easier, the music program is complemented by extensive spiritual and intellectual practice, talks, healing rituals, meditations, therapies and other activities that support the process of transformation and integration of the Boom experience.&#xA0;<br>\n<br>\nA&#xA0;nice mix of electronic and acoustic music on 2 floors, a great variety of workshops and lectures...

PETS ARE NOT ALLOWED AT BOOM!</p>\n        <p>Having a pet has many benefits, both mental and physical. Besides stress relief, pets provide entertainment, companionship, and comfort. Pets provide a distraction from one&#x2019;s own problems and can relieve depression, anxiety and even physical pain.</p>\n\n<p>With pet ownership come responsibilities. One of them is not to expose a pet to environments where they can get high levels of stress. For instance, highly potent sound systems like the ones at Boom can produce noise anxiety in pets.</p>\n\n<p>In the region of Portugal where Boom is held temperatures can rise up to 40&#xBA;C, which could cause extreme dehydration to your pet.</p>\n\n<p>Additionaly, in this region of the Iberian Peninsula, there are high rates of leishmaniasis, an illness that causes extreme pain and is deadly to pets. The subspecies of the parasite <em>leishmania donovani </em>can infect dogs, causing a disease form called visceral leishmaniasis. Dogs serve as a reservoir of infection. The disease is transmitted between dogs and to people by sandflies.</p>\n\n<p>Another issue is the fact that in past editions there has been many cases of dogs abandoned and incidents were fellow Boomers were attacked by pets that were left alone and in stress. Do you really think it is clever to bring your dog to Boom?</p>\n\n<p>Bringing your pet to Boom can be painful for your animal and can cause risks to public health. Think twice. If you are caught with your pet you will be put out of the festival.</p>\n\n<p>If you stay in Caravan Park B you can keep your dog there, always on a leash (to prevent dog fights or attacks).</p>\n\n<p>In case you need any nice hotel for your pet, here you can find some places:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Monte da Cotovia Kennel</strong></p>\n\n<p>Phone: +351 91 762 11 48</p>\n\n<p><strong>Covilh&#xE3; Kennel</strong></p>\n\n<p>Phone: +351 275 325 755</p>\n\n<p><strong style=\"line-height:1.6em;\">Quinta do C&#xF4;vo Kennel</strong></p>\n\n<p>Phone: +351 256 602 140</p>\n\n<p>Mobile: +351 96 603 48 47</p>\n\n<p><strong>&#xD3;cio do C&#xE3;o Kennel (Coimbra)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Phone: +351 91 495 26 31</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ociodocao.com/\">www.ociodocao.com</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Quinta Monte dos Vendavais Kennel (Lisboa)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Phone: +351 21 444 08 53</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.montedosvendavais.com/\">www.montedosvendavais.com</a></p>                <div class=\"bottom-spacer\"></div>\n    "

It is considered one of the oldest villages in Portugal (about 2000 years old!) founded by Romans. Later on Visigoths, Moors, and Templar Knights all left a trace of their presence: the cathedral with the biggest collection of Roman inscriptions of the Iberian peninsula, the ruins of the ancient walls, the tower of the Templars and the ruins of a roman temple dedicated to Venus are the backdrop to the simple life of the small Portuguese population living here.</p>\n\n<p class=\"columns fourteen\"><strong>Idanha-a-Nova: The nearest town</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"columns fourteen\">It&#x2019;s the nearest town to Boom Festival (18 km) where all basic commodities are available (ATM, supermarket, shops, etc.). It&#x2019;s difficult to pinpoint its origins but it&#x2019;s assumed that the construction of the castle in 1187 by the Templar Knights is a landmark.

    "title": "Boom 2016 Tickets Info",
    "body": "\n        <p class=\"summary\"></p>\n        <h3>Dear Boomer, we are grateful and honored to co-create Boom with you! The access to culture is a human right (article 27th of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights) and the creation of an alternative to the political, economic and social systems&#xA0;is a human imperative. That is our motto for the Pricing System.</h3>\n\n<p><br>\nWe live in a moment in our collective history where rights and duties are forgotten for the sake of&#xA0;human progress aiming materialism, the&#xA0;fragmentation of social classes between those who have and those who don&apos;t (Financial Absolutism), and the exhortation of the human Ego,&#xA0;through the trap of social networks leading the neo-narcissism, the projection of the self in the virtual world or&#xA0;&#x201C;Hollow-Me&#x201D;.</p>\n\n<p>It is in this context&#xA0;that Boom Festival 2016 takes place. Pricing for us is a&#xA0;social exercise: on the one hand economic (yes, economics is a social science, with its etymological root in &quot;oikos&quot;, the house - the same root as&#xA0;ecology) and on other hand, social consciousness.</p>\n\n<p>In economic terms the Boom must be a sustainable festival. It is an independent event without sponsors and based in Portugal, which means we have to deal with very high taxes. 13% of each ticket goes directly to the Portuguese State. Bars and restaurants revenue is taxed at&#xA0;23%; a Boom Bus ticket has 6% tax. At the end of the year if there are profits, the State gets 23.5% - the Boom is not based in an offshore as many events throughout the world are. Another mandatory tax is 1% of the total income goes directly to the State. On a monthly basis, per long term worker, the Boom has to pay 24,75% of the wage&#xA0;to the State and 5% for free lancers. In parallel to all this we create this cultural and artistic manifestation that is the Boom Festival!</p>\n\n<p>Our social consciousness is expressed in many ways: part of the income goes to charity (Boom Karuna Project). The profits are applied in Boomland (and especially in 2016 for&#xA0;its purchase). The running costs are in maintaining an international working team and&#xA0;projects such as the Being Gathering (former Be-In Gathering).</p>\n\n<p>We also want to be an event that honors the human right to culture (with affordable prices for&#xA0;participants) but also that encourages the participation of each one of you to get more information and tools to raise awareness for the Great Transition (which means having a quality cultural program).</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the 2016 Pricing is the result of a careful&#xA0;thinking process about the possibilities for&#xA0;Boomers and the need&#xA0;for&#xA0;being a sustainable and independent festival.</p>\n\n<p>We have chosen to have less ticket phases compared with previous editions&#xA0;to allow you more time to acquire a ticket in each phase (there are three phases in 2016 and not four phases as in 2014). We don&#x2019;t increase the highest price of the tickets (which remains at 180 &#x20AC;). We applied an average between the previous 3 ticket phases in &#x200B;&#x200B;2014 (120&#x20AC;, 140&#x20AC;, 160&#x20AC;) to obtain an average for the current value of the first two stages in 2016 (130&#x20AC;, 150&#x20AC;).</p>\n\n<h3>Furthermore, tickets for&#xA0;Boom are limited. We are focused on quality not quantity, there are 33.333 tickets available for Boom 2016.<br>\nThere are a limited number of tickets per phase. If tickets are Sold Out before the date of the&#xA0;end of the phase, the following&#xA0;Phase begins immediately.&#xA0;&#xA0;</h3>\n\n<p>We believe that every Boomer is part of the Boom Team (just as every member of the Boom Team is first and foremost a Boomer!), an essential co-creator of the festival, a contributor to the manifestation of the Boom reality out of a shared field of infinite potential.&#xA0;By purchasing a Boom ticket, you will help serve the following purposes:<br>\n&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p>&#x2022;&#xA0;Renting the Boomland (unfortunately Boom Festival doesn&#x2019;t own it). It will help us raise&#xA0;funds to buy the Boomland (deadline is September 2016th)</p>\n\n<p>&#x2022;&#xA0;Paying for materials to build Boom from scratch, over 150 ha of land: 4 music areas, the Being Fields and the Sacred Fire areas, Younger Dragon, the Liminal Village and the Visionary Art Museum, the Dance Temple as well as the Central Plaza restaurants and stage area, the Main Gate and Service Gate, dozens of art installatios, gardens, to name just a few.</p>\n\n<p>&#x2022;&#xA0;Paying the fees of 800 artists that will perform at Boom 2016.</p>\n\n<p>&#x2022;&#xA0;Payment of wages to 1200+&#xA0;workers and food for those who build Boom and work in pre-production.</p>\n\n<p>&#x2022;&#xA0;Development of a world-class environmental program including: water, sanitation, energy, bio-construction, recycling, permaculture gardens, etc.</p>\n\n<p>&#x2022;&#xA0;Support the curatorship of the art installations and performance arts.</p>\n\n<p>&#x2022;&#xA0;Design and implementation of pre-production, production, post-production and the thousands of tasks that come with all of this.</p>\n\n<p>&#x2022;&#xA0;Building of showers, toilets, water pipes, electrical circuits and all the complex logistics involved in making the Boomland a pleasant and functional home for 30.000+&#xA0;people.</p>\n\n<p>&#x2022;&#xA0;Building the caravan park, camping area and car park.</p>\n\n<p>&#x2022;&#xA0;And all the bigger or smaller details in between;&#xA0;all this to make sure all Boomers have the most unforgettable experience ever!!!</p>\n\n<p>Note: Taking into account a daily estimate of the ticket price, the average price per day for First Phase ticket holders is &#x20AC;14; Second Phase ticket price works out at &#x20AC;17 per Boom-day, and third Phase at an average of &#x20AC;20 per Boom-day.</p>\n\n<h3>As usual we set the prices taking into account the different economic realities of each country. Having this in mind, beyond the Regular Prices, we will have Friendly Price tickets and a Guest Country.</h3>\n\n<h3>&#xA0;</h3>\n\n<h3>REGULAR PRICE</h3>\n\n<p>Regular price tickets are set for people living in all European Union countries (except those mentioned below in the friendly price areas), Australia, Canada, Israel, New Zealand, USA, Oman, Qatar, United Arab Emirates.</p>\n\n<p>Regular price tickets are&#xA0;available online at our website or at your local Boom ambassador.</p>\n\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n\n<h3>FRIENDLY PRICE</h3>\n\n<p>We also have a Friendly Price for people in countries with a specific economic realities.

The situation has been changing and the&#xA0;Social Price is no longer applied for countries&#xA0;such as&#xA0;Portugal, Ireland, Cyprus or Spain.&#xA0;The only country that is subject to these&#xA0;programs is Greece, therefore Greece will be included in the Friendly Price Ticket system.&#xA0;</p>\n\n<h3>&#xA0;</h3>\n\n<h3>GUEST COUNTRY</h3>\n\n<p>As a tradition in every edition of Boom there is a guest country.

However, we come from different local scenes and different economic realities. Income levels differ from country to country, sometimes greatly. That&apos;s why we see it as our responsibility to be flexible with the ticket pricing. There will be Regular Price tickets and so-called Friendly Price tickets, for countries that are facing a harsher situation in terms of income. Friendly Price tickets are available only at the ambassadors in those countries &#x2013; Find more details and a full listing <a href=\"/boom2016/tickets/boom-tickets-info/\">on this site</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3 Phases, 1 Ongoing Ticket Sale</strong></p>\n\n<p>There will be 3 different phases &#x2013; but PLEASE KEEP IN MIND: Once the ticket sales have started, they won&apos;t stop until all 33.333 tickets for Boom 2016 have been sold. Phase 1 begins on 11<sup>th</sup> November 2015, and as soon as the total quota of this phase has been sold, we will immediately begin phase 2, and after that phase 3. There are 11.111 tickets per phase.</p>\n\n<p>Please remember: There is a limited number of tickets per phase. If tickets are sold out before the date of the&#xA0;end of the phase, the following phase begins immediately. &#xA0;</p>\n\n<p><strong>33.333 Tickets</strong></p>\n\n<p>If all tickets have been sold, there will be none at the gates of Boom Festival. To limit the number to 33.333 has been a hard decision, as it means some Boomers can&apos;t make it to the festival &#x2013; but we believe that it is quality that matters, not quantity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You Are Funding Boom, You Deserve Gratitude</strong></p>\n\n<p>If we break up the full price into a daily estimate, the average price for 1 day at Boom Festival would lie between 14 and 20 Euros, depending on the phase of the ticket sales. What you get is more than just a mind-blowing festival experience. You are funding a project that goes far beyond the scope of music and dance. You are funding a free cultural space that is the test ground for an alternative world. You are funding independency from corporations and brands. You are funding freedom.

Yes, you heard us right.</p>\n\n<p>We do not believe all things should be normal, normatized, normalized, regulated, standardized, regimented or modulated. The new ISO 20121 (Sustainable Events Standard) does not make things better, does not make the world a better place for humankind nor for other species. And yes, we know we have provided significant contribution to sustainability and good examples of how to WALK the talk. However, we must stay out of this one as we do not think that affirming corporate dellusion is the way to go.<br>\n&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"align_center\" height=\"450\" src=\"/boom2014/site/assets/files/1704/950x450_boommanifesto_1.jpg\" width=\"950\"><br>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">If you have any questions please ask our public, the ones that line up for our handmade toilets instead of the corporate portable stinker. They will tell you that in our history we have made mistakes and also have undertaken huge and visible efforts to correct them. To the point of becoming models in &quot;innovation&quot;.</span></p>\n\n<p>Yes we understand that you have been working on these &quot;standards&quot; for quite a while and that you formed committees with international representatives discussing and listening to the &quot;key stakeholders&quot;. We know your standards are kept by a well respected organisation, made up of other organisations represented in each and every country (or most of the official ones). But we dont think festivals should simply reflect the official culture. We think we must go much further than that. Festivals should be the expression of the new and therefore always challenge the status quo, not ratify it.<br>\n<br>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"align_center\" height=\"450\" src=\"/boom2014/site/assets/files/1704/950x450_boommanifesto_3.jpg\" width=\"950\"><br>\nPerhaps the problem is that you should not have defined your scope as the &quot;entertainment industry&quot; and then expect that authentic festivals would simply normalise. A festival is, by definition, a celebration in large scale. A gathering of human beings for the purpose of expressing life&#xB4;s wonders and mysteries. Indigenous nations throughout the planet still celebrate in this way and should be respected as models of harmoniously integrated living. Are you going to normalise the indigenous people in the countries you are represented?<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">We answer first to our public, to our community, as it is made up of people from 152 countries (Boom 2014). They have been asking us to be pioneers in sustainability without loosing sigth of beauty, art, music and unity. And we plan to continue doing just that. Remember that we were the first on our league to introduce dry toilets in large scale and we are still the only ones to collect and treat all the waste water biologically.</span><br>\n<br>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"align_center\" height=\"450\" src=\"/boom2014/site/assets/files/1704/950x450_boommanifesto_2.jpg\" width=\"950\"><br>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">You tell us that now we need help to understand the language of your standards and for that we probably need to employ the new experts to translate sustainability. At the same time you seem to rush to award your new ISO to some corporations better known for their green washing than for responsability. While you were busy with such abstractions and concerned about creating jobs for newly found consultants on event sustainability we were generating energy and playing music with the sun and recycled vegetable oil.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Our vision is precisely the opposite of yours. We believe it is possible to stop the destruction of our world and revert all the impact with the presence of people. We are not content with minimizing damage and remaining commercially viable. If the damage cannot be reversed there will be no commercial interest to fight for. Can&#xB4;t you see that? So this is where we draw the line and this is why we chose to not dance to this one. We say No to normalization, we say not to Sustainable Events Standard ISO 20121.</span></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"align_center\" height=\"450\" src=\"/boom2014/site/assets/files/1704/950x450_boommanifesto_4.jpg\" width=\"950\"></p>\n\n<p>By the way, without standards Boom Festival and the Boomers did all this <a href=\"http://www.boomfestival.org/boom2016/environment/\">HERE</a></p>                <div class=\"bottom-spacer\"></div>\n    "

    "body": "\n        <p class=\"summary\">Learn about some of the aquatic plants we use for our 100% biological water treatment system at Boom.</p>\n        <h3>AZOLIA</h3>\n\n<p>The floating leaves of Azolla turn from green to red as this plant absorbs nitrogen from the water. This is a beautiful thing both for the eye and the environment. Waste water usually includes a relatively high amount of nitrogen which is a bad thing for any body of standing water because it provokes an effect commonly referred to as hypertrophication.</p>\n\n<p>Have you ever seen a lake that was all green and slimy? That&#x2019;s what we are talking about. Simply speaking, there is less and less oxygen dissolved in this water, which makes it a difficult living place for all life forms that require oxygen&#x2026; and a paradise for those life forms that do not require oxygen: Anaerobic bacteria. They flourish, and by doing so they release various toxins that are not good at all for all other creatures.</p>\n\n<p>And this is how our Power Plant named Azolla works, absorbing nitrogen from the water. By the way, this makes the rotting parts of this plant a great fertilizer.</p>\n\n<h3>BULLRUSH</h3>\n\n<p>The natives of North America use bulrush as a source of food and medicine. However, please don&#x2019;t ingest the plant from our water treatment system at Boom Festival &#x2013; you might find it to taste bitter and spicy, because it includes high concentrations of pollutants (as opposed to the one found in a rural environments). The bulrush itself is perfectly fine with that &#x2013; Bulrush is a bioremediator that extracts harmful substances from waste water, including a number of metals. A perfect symbiosis: This Power Plant can live from our waste water and leaves us with clean water!</p>\n\n<h3>PAPYRUS</h3>\n\n<p>Thousands of years ago Papyrus used to be the raw material for the first sort of paper. In this respect, it also used to be the raw material for a paradigm shift, as information could be saved and distributed much easier on paper &#x2013; an expansion of global consciousness.</p>\n\n<p>Today we use the very same plant in our water treatment system at Boom Festival &#x2013; and once again, Papyrus is the raw material for a paradigm shift. One the one hand, this plant is an extremely efficient recycler of nutrients. It uses substances in the waste water for its growth, and Papyrus grows rampant. By doing so, the chemical balance of the water is recalibrated. On the other hand, Papyrus captures large amounts of atmosphere carbon dioxide (CO2), it&#x2019;s a long-term storage for the notorious &#x201C;greenhouse gas&#x201D;!</p>\n\n<h3>WATER HYACINTH</h3>\n\n<p>The water hyacinth had a problematic effect when travellers brought it from its natural habitat in the Amazon basin to places like Africa or the United States of America: It grew rampant. However, when used in a controlled environment this beautiful water plant has amazing properties. It absorbs a multitude of harmful pollutants, including metals like lead, mercury, strontium-90, and organic compounds believed to be carcinogenic - in concentrations 10,000 times that in the surrounding water! This makes it an essential &#x2018;Power Plant&#x2019; in our organic water treatment system at Boom Festival.</p>                <div class=\"bottom-spacer\"></div>\n    "

    "title": "Letter to the Boomers II (After Boom 2014)",
    "body": "\n        <p class=\"summary\">Part II - Letter to the Boomers (Post Boom 2014)</p>\n        <p>Dear Boomer</p>\n\n<p>In this 2nd letter to you, we review some feedback you&#x2019;ve sent us by email. It was an amazing edition. Some say the best ever, who knows? Boom is built upon collaboration and transparency; in this letter we&#x2019;ll focus on some of the areas where we&#x2019;ve had more constructive criticism despite the fact that 99,9% of your emails are extremely positive. We thank you all for your words!</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Boom Team: Love and Dedication</strong><br>\nThere were several new members working in 2014. The sense of family amongst the team is one of the reasons Boomers are in sync with the invisible vibe of Boom&#x2026; Everything is created by friends from all over the world that live together for months, surviving cold winters and hot summers, working countless hours with love and dedication to present the Boom for you. We once again thank all those that have been working at Boom!<br>\nMore on this HERE</p>\n\n<p><strong>Toilets and Showers: More than Ever</strong><br>\nToilets at Boom are a result of the input of many different technologies combined with years of experience. According to most people, Boom toilets have become state of the art and have raised the bar for festival sanitation. There were 53% more toilets and 30% more showers compared with 2012. In order to raise awareness on the overconsumption of water we limited use in the showers during two periods of the day (00h-06h; 12h-16h).<br>\nThere were more queues for toilets and showers but only in very specific hours of the day, not all the time. Despite this, they were kept extremely clean throughout the festival. &#xA0;<br>\nWe acknowledge that we need more showers and that they must be open for longer periods. We will work on finding new systems to decrease the water consumption. And surely we will keep increasing the number of compost toilets in the Boom Land; we love turning poo into soil!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Camping, Car Park, Caravan Area: Bigger Areas for More Space</strong><br>\nThere were several new camping zones and new caravan areas; they had showers and toilets at a close distance. The Camping and Caravan Park A was overcrowded, while some camping areas (like the new Low Noise Camping Area) still had a lot of space available. There was more public lighting and garbage collection than in previous editions. We did not anticipate so many large trucks and caravans that&#xA0; occupied more space in the caravan areas.<br>\nIn the future we will increase the services and lighting of all camping and caravan zones, we will focus on better organization and distinction between tents and caravans to avoid overcrowding.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Water Quality Was Great</strong><br>\nThe water was free at all water points across the Boom Land. Both drinking and shower water come from the public grid, and is regulated by health and safety licensing in Portugal. Some Boomers commented about the chloride in the water. We understand and feel the same, but we can&#x2019;t do anything, as public health is an imperative and that is the only solution we are currently allowed to work with. The quality of the water is monitored before, during and after the Boom with good results.<br>\nThe lake water is used for recreationally and also for irrigation of the gardens. Analysis show that the lake water has quality for recreational use (same standard as at the beach), although for some hours the water at the Funky Beach was not the best, some low-awareness-people probably piss or shit in the water, which led us to put signage at the Funky Beach on August 8th. Few hours later the situation was normal again.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Queues at Restaurants</strong><br>\nThere were queues to eat at most places, though not at all times. There were 45 food spaces in 2014 (45% more restaurants and chai shops compared with 2012). We anticipated the amount of people and shared this information with the restaurants so that they could be prepared and organize their methods differently to process more meals, but Boom has no direct control of the restaurants, we just oblige restaurants to use biodegradable cutlery. Most restaurants did their best; it is a hard job to feed thousands of people. We were not fully happy with the quality of the food in some places and for the next edition there will be replacements.<br>\nIn the future we will allow more restaurants at Boom, we are redesigning the Central Plaza and other areas to have more food spaces.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amount of People and a Great Vibe</strong><br>\nWe are happy to confirm that the decision of not selling more tickets was positive. If tickets had remained on sale, there would have been thousands more people, which would have been chaotic. Some criticized Boom for not selling more tickets, not understanding the reason for this while others criticized Boom for being a capitalist machine despite the fact there was no more ticket sales. It is hard to understand human beings and their preconceptions of &#x201C;the other&#x201D;&#x2026; &#xA0;<br>\nThere were more people than ever at Boom and we admit sometimes there was a sense of overcrowding.<br>\nBut there was also an amazing vibe, a wonderful feeling of togetherness with Boomers from 152 countries (data from etickets system) that defies all preconceptions that a large number of people translates to a bad vibe. It was friendly, peaceful, fun, blissful, and the love in the air was absolutely overwhelming!<br>\nOpinions among Boomers diverge on what a growing number of attendees brings: for some the spirit gets deluded and lost, but for others it shows there is more people ignited with psytrance, psychedelic culture or alternative ways of life and the spirit is not lost at all.<br>\nBoom Team members are also festival people. We participate in festivals, we dance in dance floors, we attend retreats or conferences, we wait in line for toilets, showers, we don&#x2019;t go to VIP camps in events, we dance near you, we eat together with you, we live alongside you and most of the feelings you have we also resonate with. Boom is always designed from the perspective of the festivalgoer; it is for you. Our commitment is with quality, contrary to most events that aim growing and getting bigger, Boom doesn&#x2019;t want to grow in numbers of people, expect less tickets available in the future.&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dogs: Too Many of our Best Friends</strong><br>\nWe love pets! But Boom is not a space for them. There were too many dogs, especially in the camping area. Dogs are not allowed at Boom and although we control their entry as much as possible at the gates, many dogs find their way in. There were incidents with dogs without owners. One positive aspect was that answering our call during Boom, many dog owners started to use a leash.<br>\nIn the future the control for dogs will be bigger and we are trying to create partnerships with local kennels.</p>\n\n<p><strong>ATM Machines: Not Enough and Won&#x2019;t Increase</strong><br>\nThere were 3 ATM machines and you can use cards on vendors that sell basic needs. We acknowledge ATM machines were not enough. But we don&#x2019;t want to promote overconsumption, being at Boom is not being at a shopping center, organize differently and don&#x2019;t be dependent on the banks,<br>\nthe number of ATM machines will not increase.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kids and Special Needs</strong><br>\nWe are very happy to see more kids and families at Boom. The special needs Boomers also had better conditions with a dedicated team to take care of them, new facilities and even an inclusive shuttle transporting people with low mobility across the land.<br>\nWe will keep expanding the area for the children with new ideas and new teams. We will keep on improving the support for the Boomers with special needs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cigarette Butts and Garbage After the Boom</strong><br>\nThere was a team of 315 people cleaning Boom 24/7. In the beginning of the festival most Boomers were very committed to cleaning their living spaces. The large majority display conscious environmental behavior but some people didn&#x2019;t get it yet. Towards the end there was more accumulation of garbage and the amount of cigarette butts on the ground was not according to Boom standards.<br>\nOn the dance floors, confetti was widespread this year and this means a lot of garbage left behind. At the time we are writing this letter (September 15th) we are still cleaning cigarette butts and confetti onsite.<br>\nWe will increase the numbers of cleaning teams; we&#x2019;ll need more pocket ashtrays, more ashtrays around the site and will improve on more eco-signage! But no matter how many projects we take on, you are the one that can make the difference! RESPECT NATURE!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lack of Programs and Newspapers</strong><br>\nThis year we debuted the Boom App, more than 6.000 downloads in just a few weeks. The idea was to reduce paper, as the App is handier than pocket programs. Distributed on location there were 30.000 Boom newspapers, 30.000 pocket programs, 2.500 Liminal Village booklets, 2.000 Healing Area booklets. Were they enough? No. Were there programs on the walls? Yes. We don&#x2019;t regret not printing more, we want you to be surprised with content and not with names, Boom is an experience. (Note: if you want to know more about the programs you can download them all now at the Boom website)<br>\nBeing informed is what makes humans evolve so we will keep expanding our multi-media communication projects in the future.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lost &amp; Found: Get your Lost Items!</strong><br>\nA few of you have left behind some of your belongings and we would&#xA0;very much like to see you receive them back! For those that lost their belongings we have a microsite with what we&#x2019;ve found. Please go HERE. You can also connect with us: lostandfound@boomfestival.org.</p>\n\n<p><br>\nWe are sure there is a lot more to talk about Boom 2014. We had many positive achievements and we failed on some levels. Still, we were driven by the brightest intention to work hard - we tried our best! It was a wonderful edition that will stay in our hearts forever and will motivate all of us to do better in 2016.<br>\nWe will continue our series of letters to you in the following weeks. In order to revive the Boom memories, tune in with our social media channels and website to get music, photos, videos and talks of Boom 2014.</p>\n\n<p>THANK YOU BOOMER</p>\n\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p>&#xA0;</p>                <div class=\"bottom-spacer\"></div>\n    "

    "title": "(Eco) Letter To The Boomers III (After Boom 2014)",
    "body": "\n        <p class=\"summary\">(Eco) Letter To The Boomers III</p>\n        <p>DEAR BOOMER</p>\n\n<p>In this letter we share the results from the Boom 2014 Environmental Program. The Boom team is inspired by the visions and methods of Permaculture to develop do-it-yourself projects that empower people, enhance biodiversity, and maximize the festival&#x2019;s ability to create a positive environmental impact. The solutions we&#x2019;ve adopted over the years such as compost toilets, plant based water treatment facilities, waste veggie oil for generators and machines, solar and wind energy supplies, soil regeneration, reforestation, recycling/reusing materials and bio-construction techniques are setting the standards worldwide for large scale sustainable events.<br>\nWe know that there is still more progress to be made, so please share your environmental ideas with the Boom Team to help make the festival, and the world, a better place.</p>\n\n<p><strong>WATER</strong><br>\n&#x2022; 4.929.000 litres of water were used in the showers and restaurants. All the used water has been treated in the onsite water treatment facility with plants and will eventually flow back to the land.</p>\n\n<p><strong>COMPOST TOILETS</strong><br>\n&#x2022; 253 m3 of solid waste was produced during Boom. The digestion is actively taking place and in approximately one year the solids will turn into compost that will be used to create soil! &#xA0;<br>\n&#x2022; 156.000 litres of liquid fertilizer was produced and later will<br>\nbe used on Boom gardens. &#xA0;<br>\n&#x2022; The dry compost system in use at Boom saved 249.464 litres<br>\nof water compared to conventional toilets.</p>\n\n<p><strong>WASTE MANAGEMENT VS CO2 OFFSET</strong><br>\n&#x2022; The Eco Team separated garbage and recycling onsite, avoiding the emissions of 64 tons of CO2 by removing recyclables<br>\nfrom the landfill waste.<br>\n&#x2022; The We Make Soil Project (collecting organic waste at the Central Plaza to create compost) avoided emissions of 23 tons of CO2 by using organic waste for compost rather than sending it to a landfill. &#xA0;<br>\n&#x2022; Compost Toilets at Boom eliminated the need to send solid waste to a chemical treatment plant and avoided the emissions<br>\nof 5 tons of CO2.<br>\n&#x2022; With the project Reuse Materials of Rock&#x2019;n&#x2019;Rio Lisboa festival, Boom avoided the emission of 166 tons of CO2, by eliminating the need to purchase new materials. The need for re-usable materials was lower compared to 2012 so Boom brought less materials from Rock&#x2019;n&#x2019;Rio this edition.&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p><strong>COMPOST</strong><br>\n&#x2022; The We Make Soil project produced 44 tons of organic waste that were sent to a composting plant. It is expected that 1/5 of this amount will be turned into compost to be used on agriculture at the Boom Land.<br>\n&#x2022; It is also expected that the Compost Toilets of Boom 2014, will produce 50,6m3 of usable compost.</p>\n\n<p><br>\n<strong>REDUCE, REUSE, RECYCLE, UPCYCLE</strong><br>\nSEPARATION OF BOTH RECYCLABLE MATERIALS AND ORGANIC WASTE</p>\n\n<p>We did improvements on the amount of separation of recyclable materials and organic waste.</p>\n\n<p>&#x2022; Eco Team avoided sending 25 tons of recycled garbage to the landfill.<br>\n&#x2022; We Make Soil avoided 44 tons of organic waste to be sent to the landfill.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOTAL WASTE</strong><br>\nWe are happy to report that we decreased the amount of garbage to be sent to the landfill and, at the same time, increased the amount of separation of both organics and recyclable items.</p>\n\n<p><strong>ENERGY</strong><br>\nSince 2008 Boom has projects of cleaner Energy supply. Started with waste veggie oil on generators in 2008, it has been increasingly using more solar energy. For more info please check the Boom website (www.boomfestival.org)</p>\n\n<p><strong>CARSHARE</strong><br>\nTo support social travels and lower carbon impact due to private travels, Boom partnered with Liftshare website (www.liftshare.com) to give Boomers an option for their travels. 2560 journeys were registered representing a 27% increase from 2012.</p>\n\n<p><strong>GARDENS</strong><br>\n&#x2022; 33.000 m2 of gardens were created at Boom 2012. In 2014, an additional 18.500 m2 of gardens were planted offsetting 462 kg of CO2.<br>\n&#x2022; In 2014, there was a total of 51.500 m2 of gardens equally an annual offset of 1.3 tons of CO2.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DID YOU ALSO KNOW THAT</strong><br>\n&#x2022; It is mandatory for all restaurants to use biodegradable cutlery.<br>\n&#x2022; Boom provided 30.000 pocket ashtrays.<br>\n&#x2022; Boom supports local food producers by buying most of the food for workers from the region and by providing the restaurants at Boom a list of local producers that deliver products on a daily basis.<br>\n&#x2022; Boom Environmental Program is 100% independent, in partnership with Ecocentro IPEC, with dozens of volunteers and eco-enthusiasts. It is funded by ticket sales alone.<br>\n&#x2022; Between 2012 and 2014 Boom planted around 2000 trees at the Boom Land.<br>\n&#x2022; 3000 plants were planted specifically for Boom 2014.<br>\n&#x2022; 80.000 litres of water were pumped daily from the lake for irrigation using a solar pump. The water goes back into the hydrologic cycle of the Boom Land<br>\n&#x2022; There is free water at dozens of water points at&#xA0; the Boom Land<br>\n&#x2022; Boom has 4 compost toilets for special needs people.<br>\n&#x2022; There were 630km of toilet paper used in the compost toilets.<br>\n&#x2022; At the Boom official bars priority goes to make available both ethical and/or local products: natural fruits juices (sugar free),<br>\nwater and beer are all Portuguese. There is fair trade cola.<br>\nBoth ice tea and coconut water are organic. The only drinks that we didn&apos;t find proper good quality alternatives from small brands are guaran&#xE1; and energy drink.<br>\n&#x2022; 90 straw bales from the Boom Land<br>\nwere used for construction of Boom 2014.<br>\n&#x2022; 50.000 watts of power per day were produced with solar panels.<br>\n&#x2022; 376 flower lamps were made from recycled materials<br>\n(remember at the Sacred Fire?)<br>\n&#x2022; 43 medusa lamps were made with recycled plastic bottles.<br>\n&#x2022; The Boom By Bike Initiative has seen the number of bikers coming to Boom increase each edition. For every 500km cycled,<br>\ntheir carbon footprint was reduced by 0.10 tons of CO2.<br>\n&#x2022; There were 27 workshops on environmental related themes.<br>\n&#x2022; Boom has been audited by several institutions and won the following awards: Outstanding Greener Festival Awards 2008, 2010, 2012. Green&#xA0; Inspiration Award 2012. European Festival Award &#x2013;Green&apos;n&apos;Clean Festival of the Year 2010. United Nations Music &amp; Environment Stakeholder Initiative Partner.</p>\n\n<p>Note: Students of Environmental Engineering of Instituto Superior T&#xE9;cnico &#x2013; University of Lisboa, assessed the data presented. The methodology is based on emission factors of European Union regulations and Environmental Protection Agency (USA). Boom Environmental Program is based on a Permaculture vision.</p>\n\n<p>Thank You Boomer For Your Inspiration!<br>\nWe Are Love</p>                <div class=\"bottom-spacer\"></div>\n    "

    "body": "\n        <p class=\"summary\">Letter to the Boomers I (Released After Boom 2014)</p>\n        <p>Dear Boomer</p>\n\n<p>As days go by, we keep cleaning and dismantling all the magnificent structures that were built. We feel like those monks who create the Kalachakra mandalas, resonating with the invisible architecture of the cosmos, honoring the continuous flux of creation and destruction.</p>\n\n<p>The amount of love and dedication that was manifested for more than a year by hundreds of people of the Boom Team is beyond words. Thanks to all the team members who designed, built and worked for Boom Festival 2014, the love you put in every single detail was felt by thousands of people. That is the subtle and deep power of intention in action&#x2026;</p>\n\n<p>The art that was created by countless artists brought us all to the next level of evolution, creating a world that still reverberates inside our hearts. Mind blowing temporary architecture, stunning art installations made of different media and materials were spread all over the Boom Land. Amazing and diverse psychedelic music played on four stages, while countless performers showed how the human body can be used as a powerful vehicle of expression. And a big thank you to all speakers, spiritual masters, therapists and workshop leaders who shared their knowledge, wisdom, mastery and passion with all of us, inspiring us towards a more evolved vision of ourselves and the world.</p>\n\n<p>The Boomers&#x2026; People from 151&#xA0;countries gathered together to co-create an alternative reality. Is there a place where so many of us from so many remote places can meet up without the constraints of dominant culture in a reality rooted in art, peace, love and sustainability? What we lived together is much more than a neo-tribal gathering, it is already the living manifestation of a (new) world that transcend nationalities, backgrounds and cultural conditionings. Thank you Boomers, much gratitude for your endless support, thank you for making Boom what it is today! You are the festival and our inspiration. &#xA0;</p>\n\n<p>Thank you from the bottom of our hearts!</p>\n\n<p>As the Moon phases follow their cosmic flow, our memories of the past Full Moon are a stream of pure bliss&#x2026;</p>\n\n<p>THANK YOU.</p>\n\n<p>Ps: In the next newsletters we will let you know more about Boom Environmental Program results, the Boom Land challenges and crowdfunding, the Boom Be In Festival, Boom 2016 dates and countless other news from the Boom Festival. Stay tuned!</p>                <div class=\"bottom-spacer\"></div>\n    "
